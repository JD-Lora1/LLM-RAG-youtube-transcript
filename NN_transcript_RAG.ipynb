            "so i'll switch now to english uh i think it's the it's the language tedx andre the rest all the organizers thank you very much for your invitation it's uh with the an enormous pleasure that uh talking about my dream and trying to spread also the word uh what is my idea what do i want to do the the name of my presentation is it's called blogging for a dream i think you identify what's this this is antarctica southern most southern continent of the this will be a pretty light easygoing i hope you enjoy it and this happened two months ago i received an email from from a company a north american company called quark on this email i had i was they were challenging me something like luis monteiro i know you are interest interested in the antarctica things that surround the antarctic so i challenge you to enter in a where you could win a trip to antarctica this email had something like three four first question to enter in the do you have a passion for polar regions this question to me is pretty simple to the past 10 years i've been a dream that had grown within the years i started 10 years ago watching the stories and tv series regarding bbc tv series national i started investigating a little bit what is what is this continent what it's and i got fashion fascinated completely right now my house it's like a frozen but without the ice something like that magazines postcards dvds books i love the antarctic and it's difficult why are you why do you have a passion do love your wife or do you know why you something you can't explain so for me uh what i would like to to show you is that uh it's a bit difficult to to explain a i think we all have this this difficulty but i would like to ask you to close your eyes for 20 seconds and to hear a sound that was recorded and that was uh that was sent to me by someone that knows this dream that took the took part of this stream it's quite a bit it's a sound recorded in the antarctica so what i ask you is close your eyes for 20 seconds and uh try to imagine something please just yeah no problem as you wish please close your eyes 20 seconds and be part of this world thank you did you feel anything it's it's immersive right it's it's strong it's the sound of a glacier you you are in a it's the sound of a glacier and in the antarctica you will feel uh you will feel that you are in the untouched the most unspoiled and and at earth and well we have to so i think i've passed a little bit what is this passion second question they are you committed to the environment we all right now we we always uh sorry we of course we are committed to the environment and of course i am i try the best as i can to at work at home in my community to reuse to recycle the three hours and to reduce of course so right now global warming is killing the arctic and it's killing the so i'm not here uh i'm not an ecologist or a scientist in fact i am an i.t consultant so something uh different an i.t consultant that wants to go to antarctica so uh of course i am committed and of if i take this chance if i take this chance on this competition of course i will take advantage of it and try to spread the word the word of how this is affecting the antarctic okay another question that was made to me do you have an insatiable urge to uh i really don't think i have to answer because this is my workplace so as you can see i have this little collection about of penguins penguin a penguin it's my favorite it's the funniest and it's also the most amazing animal have you seen a underwater it's like a jet so he sees some krill it's amazing what about blogging do you blog with quite simple well in fact yes i do blog since 2002. i start blogging because i've worked abroad for three years now i've worked in serbia i've worked in brazil and in belgium and that i wanted that my family would be part and would know what i what i was i created a blog a personal blog it's written in portuguese it's called stone blog in fact the blog is called means in portuguese it means i am i am this is what i would like to to to pass this is what i i wanted to pass for my family and for my friends okay i'm not with you guys but i'm on the internet so go check in and what i what are right there it's life stories diaries in portuguese this is i'm really really excited this is my last post in my personal blog that i'm really excited that for the first time i went to my car to the inspection vehicle inspection and it and believe me i tried to go to an inspection at 8 00 a.m in second vine and you will know what i'm talking about so what i did i created the post on the and i've placed the name of my post it's it's a famous sentence of a tv series to to pass to everybody which could vote for for this competition that if i win i'm gonna be creative i'm gonna be uh i'm gonna give the best of me and i will uh i will give you an a legendary description of this of the dream after entering in the competition in one double room antarctica dot com and aim and it's because it's in english okay i have a portuguese and an english blog and after this my friends uh i lost control okay because i started the words uh on the internet and of we've created uh all kinds of registries in all kinds of internet social network networks uh twitter facebook google and in in a short period of time uh for in in facebook our calls in in two months this project has two months it already has something like two to two thousand and five hundred members following this dream and trying to to to because i'm not doing this alone so as i have an enormous group of friends that that is helping me and that are giving me all the strength and all the the energy i need to not to give up and until the end of competition which is in 15 days okay so i have 15 days to gather the most number of votes after a certain period of time we've decided okay we've lost a little bit the control and we said okay it's time to go national let's let's put it on national media mass media let's do what i did i dressed up as a penguin i wanted to fulfill the dream come on what would you do to fulfill a dream so i dressed up as a penguin and sorry but things just started to happen so right now uh after this presentation i will work a little bit and at night i'll be in rtp2 again uh spreading this stream how did we do what's the secret give a hundred percent in everything you you do i really don't have this is not a recipe for or anything but this is how it i'm just myself well this is me this is how i am here there i'm a from villarreal in the north of portugal i live in lisbon i work as an i.t well and i have a dream share the with everybody have fun with it and most of all for me be totally unpredictable and to do this i'll ask you to sing with me this is tedx for the first time people will sing it's quite simple vote in the pingu and let's send him to antarctica are you ready let's send him to one third now i'm in first place i have 15 days left and i have a lot of trying to grab me but they will not make so please go to the website if you want and spread the word and vote a vote is a simple email it's a mix of touristic expedition but i will go with a with a group of which main objective is to spread the global warming so but what i really want is to put my feedback\n",
